# Intro

## Why American Sign Language?

For millennia, deaf people were neither considered humans nor were they treated with respect. Nobody even tried to communicate with them. But this injustice against them started coming to an end in the Renaissance, when people understood that deaf people were also capable of language. <b>`The person who played a big role in this transformation Charles-Michel de l'Épée, a French priest and philanthropist, who is now hailed as the Father of the deaf.`</b>
             
In the 1700s, Charles-Michel de l'Épée had a chance encounter with two young deaf sisters who were communicating with sign language. This inspired him to dedicate his life for the deaf. Soon, he developed a system of instruction of the French language and religion using the sign language and founded the world's first free school for the deaf.
 
Decades later, De lÉpée's methods inspired Laurent Clerc, a deaf teacher from France. In 1815, Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet, an American searching for a way to teach
the deaf, met Clerc. Gallaudet invited Clerc to come to the USA. Once they arrived there, Clerc taught Gallaudet how to use the sign language, and in return, 
Gallaudet taught Clerc English. Together, they established the first school for the deaf Connecticut in the USA, where it stands even today (Source: <a href ="https://www.hearinglikeme.com/sign-languages-around-the-world/#:~:text=American%20Sign%20Language%20(ASL)%20is,Thomas%20Gallaudet%20and%20Laurent%20Clerc." target="_blank">www.hearinglikeme.com</a>). This is how ASL came into existence. Today, ASL is the widely used sign language across the world, with signers in the USA, Canada, Mexico, Africa, and Asia (Source: <a href = "https://www.amazon.com/American-Sign-Language-Workbook-Vocabulary/dp/1646119509" target="_blank">American Sign Language Workbook</a>). That's why I chose ASL - To help as much as many people as possible. 

## What can Signa do for you?

Either way, Signa can be a great companion who can help you reach your goal faster. After all, everyone deserves to make friends despite the abilities they are born with. 
And Signa is your key to doing that.

# Usage
NB: I'm using Windows 10.

## Installing libraries

I suggest creating a virtual environment and installing the libraries there.

       cd sign_language_folder
       python -m venv your_virtual_env_name
